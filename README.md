# Minesweeper game

Technologies:
- React
- TypeScript
- Vite

As a child, I loved the game "minesweeper", I remembered it and the idea came to me that I could not just play it, but I could create it myself, so this project was born.

Here I was able to practice algorithms and different code patterns: SOLID, DRY, KISS, etc.
